# SetOverwrite

## Syntax

SapObject.SapModel.DesignConcrete.Hong\_Kong\_CP\_2004.SetOverwrite

## VB6 Procedure

Function SetOverwrite(ByVal Name As String, ByVal Item As Long, ByVal Value As Double, Optional ByValItemType As eItemType = Object) As Long

## Parameters

Name

The name of an existing frame object or group, depending on the value of the ItemType item.

Item

This is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive, indicating the overwrite item considered.

1 = Framing type

2 = Live load reduction factor

3 = Unbraced length ratio, Major

4 = Unbraced length ratio, Minor

5 = Effective length factor, Beta Major

6 = Effective length factor, Beta Minor

7 = Moment coefficient, Cm Major

8 = Moment coefficient, Cm Minor

9 = Non-sway moment factor, Dns Major

10 = Non-sway moment factor, Dns Minor

11 = Sway moment factor, Ds Major

12 = Sway moment factor, Ds Minor

Value

The value of the considered overwrite item.

1 = Framing type

0 = Program Default

1 = Sway

2 = Non-sway

2 = Live load reduction factor

Value >= 0; 0 means use program determined value.

3 = Unbraced length ratio, Major

Value >= 0; 0 means use program determined value.

4 = Unbraced length ratio, Minor

Value >= 0; 0 means use program determined value.

5 = Effective length factor, Beta Major

Value >= 0; 0 means use program determined value.

6 = Effective length factor, Beta Minor

Value >= 0; 0 means use program determined value.

7 = Moment coefficient, Cm Major

Value >= 0; 0 means use program determined value.

8 = Moment coefficient, Cm Minor

Value >= 0; 0 means use program determined value.

9 = Non-sway moment factor, Dns Major

Value >= 0; 0 means use program determined value.

10 = Non-sway moment factor, Dns Minor

Value >= 0; 0 means use program determined value.

11 = Sway moment factor, Ds Major

Value >= 0; 0 means use program determined value.

12 = Sway moment factor, Ds Minor

Value >= 0; 0 means use program determined value.

ItemType

This is one of the following items in the eItemType enumeration:

Object = 0

Group = 1

SelectedObjects = 2

If this item is Object, the assignment is made to the frame object specified by the Name item.

If this item is Group, the assignment is made to all frame objects in the group specified by the Name item.

If this item is SelectedObjects, assignment is made to all selected frame objects, and the Name item is ignored.

## Remarks

This function sets the value of a concrete design overwrite item.

The function returns zero if the item is successfully set; otherwise it returns a nonzero value.

## VBA Example



```
Sub SetConcreteDesignOverwriteItemHong_Kong_CP_2004()

   'dimension variables

      Dim SapObject as cOAPI

      Dim SapModel As cSapModel

      Dim ret As Long



   'create Sap2000 object

      Set SapObject = CreateObject("CSI.SAP2000.API.SapObject")



   'start Sap2000 application

      SapObject.ApplicationStart



   'create SapModel object

      Set SapModel = SapObject.SapModel



   'initialize model

      ret = SapModel.InitializeNewModel



   'create new concrete frame section property

      ret = SapModel.PropFrame.SetRectangle("R1", "4000Psi", 20, 12)



   'create model from template

      ret = SapModel.File.New2DFrame(PortalFrame, 2, 144, 2, 288, True, "R1", "R1")



   'set concrete design code

      ret = SapModel.DesignConcrete.SetCode("Hong Kong CP 2004")



   'set overwrite item

      ret = SapModel.DesignConcrete.Hong_Kong_CP_2004.SetOverwrite("8", 1, 2)



   'close Sap2000

      SapObject.ApplicationExit False

      Set SapModel = Nothing

      Set SapObject = Nothing

End Sub
```
