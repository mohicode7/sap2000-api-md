# VerifyPassed

## Syntax

SapObject.SapModel.DesignColdFormed.VerifyPassed

## VB6 Procedure

Function VerifyPassed(ByRef NumberItems As Long, ByRef n1 As Long, ByRef n2 As Long, ByRef MyName() As String) As Long

## Parameters

NumberItems

The number of cold formed frame objects that did not pass the design check or have not yet been checked.

n1

The number of cold formed frame objects that did not pass the design check.

n2

The number of cold formed frame objects that have not yet been checked.

MyName

This is an array that includes the name of each frame object that did not pass the design check or has not yet been checked.

## Remarks

This function retrieves the names of the frame objects that did not pass the design check or have not yet been checked, if any.

The function returns zero if the names are successfully retrieved; otherwise it returns a nonzero value.

   'create Sap2000 object

      Set SapObject = CreateObject("CSI.SAP2000.API.SapObject")

   'create SapModel object

      Set SapModel = SapObject.SapModel



   'initialize model

   'run analysis

      ret = SapModel.File.Save("C:\SapAPI\x.sdb")

      ret = SapModel.Analyze.RunAnalysis



   'start cold formed design

      ret = SapModel.DesignColdFormed.StartDesign



   'verify frame objects successfully designed

      ret = SapModel.DesignColdFormed.VerifyPassed(NumberItems, n1, n2, MyName)



   'close Sap2000
