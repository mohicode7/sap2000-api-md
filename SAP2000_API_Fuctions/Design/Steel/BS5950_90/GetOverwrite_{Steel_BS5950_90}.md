32 = Demand/capacity ratio limit

Value >= 0; 0 means use program determined value.

ProgDet

If this item is True, the specified value is program determined.

## Remarks

This function retrieves the value of a steel design overwrite item.

The function returns zero if the item is successfully retrieved; otherwise it returns a nonzero value.

## VBA Example



```
Sub GetSteelDesignOverwriteItemBS5950_90()

   'dimension variables

      Dim SapObject as cOAPI

      Dim SapModel As cSapModel

      Dim ret As Long

      Dim Value As Double

      Dim ProgDet As Boolean



   'create Sap2000 object

      Set SapObject = CreateObject("CSI.SAP2000.API.SapObject")



   'start Sap2000 application

      SapObject.ApplicationStart



   'create SapModel object

      Set SapModel = SapObject.SapModel



   'initialize model

      ret = SapModel.InitializeNewModel



   'create model from template

      ret = SapModel.File.New2DFrame(PortalFrame, 2, 144, 2, 288)



   'set steel design code

      ret = SapModel.DesignSteel.SetCode("BS5950 90")



   'run analysis

      ret = SapModel.File.Save("C:\SapAPI\x.sdb")

      ret = SapModel.Analyze.RunAnalysis



   'start steel design

      ret = SapModel.DesignSteel.StartDesign



   'get overwrite item

      ret = SapModel.DesignSteel.BS5950_90.GetOverwrite("8", 1, Value, ProgDet)



   'close Sap2000

      SapObject.ApplicationExit False

      Set SapModel = Nothing

      Set SapObject = Nothing
