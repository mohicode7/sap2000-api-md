## Remarks

This function retrieves the value of a steel design overwrite item.

The function returns zero if the item is successfully retrieved; otherwise it returns a nonzero value.

## VBA Example



```
Sub GetSteelDesignOverwriteItemAISC_LRFD93()

   'dimension variables

      Dim SapObject as cOAPI

      Dim SapModel As cSapModel

      Dim ret As Long

      Dim Value As Double

      Dim ProgDet As Boolean



   'create Sap2000 object

      Set SapObject = CreateObject("CSI.SAP2000.API.SapObject")



   'start Sap2000 application

      SapObject.ApplicationStart



   'create SapModel object

      Set SapModel = SapObject.SapModel



   'initialize model

      ret = SapModel.InitializeNewModel



   'create model from template

      ret = SapModel.File.New2DFrame(PortalFrame, 2, 144, 2, 288)



   'set steel design code

      ret = SapModel.DesignSteel.SetCode("AISC-LRFD93")



   'run analysis

      ret = SapModel.File.Save("C:\SapAPI\x.sdb")

      ret = SapModel.Analyze.RunAnalysis



   'start steel design

      ret = SapModel.DesignSteel.StartDesign



   'get overwrite item

      ret = SapModel.DesignSteel.AISC_LRFD93.GetOverwrite("8", 1, Value, ProgDet)



   'close Sap2000

      SapObject.ApplicationExit False

      Set SapModel = Nothing

      Set SapObject = Nothing
